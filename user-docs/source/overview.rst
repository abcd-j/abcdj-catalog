This documentation provides you with step-wise instructions on how you can contribute data to the ABCD-J catalog. 
But, first things first...

What is a data catalog?
=======================

A data catalog is a website that displays and organises information that you provide about your 
collected datasets.

Why should you contribute to the ABCD-J data catalog?
=====================================================

The purpose of this catalog is to encourage collaboration between partner sites. If all ABCD-J partners 
between Aachen (A), Bönn (B), Cologne (C), Düsseldorf (D), and Jülich (J) share a common data catalog 
(the ABCD-J catalog) which showcases their respective collected datasets, partners can more easily engage 
in potential collaborations with each other as they can see what data has already been collected at each 
site.

What is metadata?
=================

Metadata is information that describes a dataset, such as its title, description, author, date of 
collection, file format and size, etc. Importantly, metadata does not include the data files themselves.
Metadata is also the format in which datasets are contributed to the ABCD-J catalog.

What about privacy concerns related to personal data in these datasets?
=======================================================================

The ABCD-J data catalog only makes metadata (i.e. descriptive fields about your dataset) openly available,
there is no need to make the actual data file content publicly accessible. In other words, you do not
need to upload sensitive data (or publicly available data, for that matter) anywhere in order for the dataset
to be part of the catalog, just metadata. Providing full access to a dataset, or merely to a limited description
about a dataset is entirely within your control. If a partner wishes to pursue a collaboration regarding a certain
dataset, that partner will still need to follow the existing institutional routes of requesting access to
your dataset. You have FULL control over what information is displayed in the catalog, and if you want the
data files to be publicly accessible or not.

So how do I contribute metadata to the ABCD-J catalog?
======================================================
